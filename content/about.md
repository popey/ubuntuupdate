Hello! This is a personal project website by me, [Alan Pope](https://popey.com/), Developer Advocate at [Canonical](https://canonical.com). Although I work at Canonical, this is a project maintained on my own time and hosted on a VPS I pay for. Consider it just another personal blog where I can collect thoughts and articles about [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

One of my goals for 2020 is to improve my writing skills, and one sure-fire way to achieve that is to just do more of it. While I do sometimes write blog articles as part of my work, those are created based on requirements in my work. Ubuntu Update is more of a place where I can write freely, about a topic I like, without being seen as the official 'Company Line'.

While the blog and content should be considered 'unofficial', it's written by someone working at Canonical, with a particular perspective. 

Eagled-eyed viewers will likely know I already have a [blog](https://popey.com/) which unsurprisingly is hosted nearby, on this very same VPS. I am keen to have a separate, more focused place to put my Ubuntu thoughts. 

Of secondary interest I wanted to try out a different workflow for publishing. The content on this blog is published via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). True to their marketing word, Hugo is indeed pretty fast, and perhaps we'll have an article about that, once I'm further than just knee-deep in. All the code and content is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/popey/ubuntuupdate).

The VPS is hosted by [BitFolk](https://bitfolk.com/) who aren't sponsoring the site or content, but they're friends, and I like their services. If you're looking for a reliable VPS host, consider using [BitFolk](https://bitfolk.com/). Tell them I sent you. :)
